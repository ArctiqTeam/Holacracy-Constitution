  <p>Arctiq does not resell hardware, nor cloud platforms, rather we support our clients when deploying on their premise, or in any cloud.
    By remaining agnostic on the base platform, Arctiq is able to guide our clients toward the best solution every time.
    We work closely with Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, AWS, IBM, even on premise environments - many of our critical client deployments are performed on-premise with an eye to future hybrid cloud connectivity.</p>
  <p>Arctiq’s ecosystem also includes key VAR’s who represent our routes to market, making it easy for clients with traditional IT procurement vehicles to work with us on solutions instead of paperwork.</p>
