# Contributing to arctiq.ca

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Arctiq.ca and its packages. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

### New to git?

* Learn [git](https://try.github.io/)

### Writing blogs

* Follow [this](https://www.notion.so/arctiqhome/Arctiq-s-Website-Manual-b066e9d2a7ab4a6da5fe33c0f52f6f57)

### Commit messages

* Keep it short. These are commit messages, not best man speeches.

## Pull Requests for Everything

Opening a Github issues doesn't require you to learn anything new, write
any code, or even *see* the source code of the project. If we turn off
issues, then the only feedback mechanism is a pull request. Let's
explore the only use-cases I can think of for issues, and how they can
be handled with pull requests.

### Think you found a bug?

**Fork the repo**

* Add an example in the repo that illustrates the bug.

### Create an issue

Use a template when creating issues so it is clear to the team what the issue is. Avoid using vague, one liners to describe the issues. Everyone will appreciate the extra 5 minutes taken to write the issue in a template. 

### Want to discuss a feature?

Talking about code is often fruitless until there's some actual code to
talk about. Pull requests require some code in order to start a
conversation.

_Please open an issue before submitting an overhaul or a drastic change in a PR_

**Write a proof of concept and make a pull request**. Nothing is better
than code that kind of works when discussing features. It reveals
shortcomings of the current code and helps everybody understand better
what it's going take.

### Have a question?

Okay, we can't do pull requests for this. But issues are a terrible
place for questions anyway. Read the docs, read the examples, go to
stack overflow. Questions aren't issues. Use `#a-website`
